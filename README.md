# PlantSimilairtyMatrixCalculator
A 35 line program to calculate the similarity matrix for N planets distance to sun, radius, and mass.

Use gravitational constants to compare N planets as data points for similiarty matrix
to find how strongly two planets are related in terms of orbit, volume, and density. 

Prints out average similiarty score matrix.
